This documentation contains implementation details associated with the *guest-checkout* and *registered-account* features introduced by v2.0.0 of ***One-Page Checkout*** (*OPC*) and augments the information already present in the plugin's readme. The roots of OPC's *guest-checkout* and *registered-account* processing (*OPC-GC/RA*) are found in the [COWOA](https://www.zen-cart.com/showthread.php?196995-COWOA-%28for-ZC-v1-5-x%29) (by @DivaVocals, @countrycharm and others) and [COWAA](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2131) (by @davewest) plugins &hellip; but the implementation is quite different.
